# Greeting Customers

We greet customers dozens of times each day. Handling customers can be
tricky because you have to be atuned to how a customer might react to what
you say. This page will deal with the proper way to handle customers and how to
deal with upset or difficult customers.

It's good to remember that each customer has had a whole day. It could be a good day or
a bad day, but they had some kind of day dealing with some kind of problem just like you.
A lot of people who come in will have spent many hours working hard or are anxious to make a deadline. They may see us as a barrier
between them and the equipment they need to finish their job. Customers will sometimes get upset with you
when you give them bad news and there's no way around it. It might feel tempting to cave to
a customer who is desparate to do something that is against our policies, but it's important 
to remember that our policies are written to protect ourselves and customers.

Sometimes you might not feel confident that you know our policies well enough and a customer
might say something along the lines of

### "Well, *I've* done this before"

This is *never* a good enough reason to do anything for a customer. If you're feeling unsure, don't be afraid to ask your manager.
