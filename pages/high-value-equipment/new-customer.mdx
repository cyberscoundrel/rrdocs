# New Customers

New customers recieving high value items(over $5000 in value) are subject
to more scrutiny and screening than customers for smaller less valuable pieces
of equipment. Nothing can be as disrupting to a rental business than 
a large and expensive piece of equipment being stolen, so we have to be
extra careful especially with new customers.

This includes:

 - Trucks
 - Trailers
 - Skid steers
 - Excavators
 - 8hp Tillers
 - 18" sod cutters
 - Micro trencers
 - Roller paver
 - Generators
 - Walk behind grinders
 - Walk behind cement saws
