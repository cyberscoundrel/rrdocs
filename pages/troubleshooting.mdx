# Troubleshooting

Everyday, some customers will have trouble with some part of the rental process or the equipment
itself. It's important to have an outline in your head for how to properly handle our customers who are
having difficulties with either. Here is a simplified guide for how to do that. In practice, it will never
be as simple as this graph, but this is a good starting place as your knowledge of the equipment and our
procedures grows.
